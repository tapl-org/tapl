# Why $\theta$ (Theta)?

The calculus was originally named $\xi$-calculus because the lowercase xi visually
evokes stacked horizontal lines, suggesting layers. However, $\xi$ conflicts with
established uses in automated theorem proving, so a new letter was needed.

## Candidates considered

| Letter | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| $\alpha$ (alpha) | Taken — alpha conversion/equivalence |

| $\epsilon$ (epsilon) | Taken — Hilbert's $\epsilon$-calculus (choice function) |
| $\zeta$ (zeta) | Taken — Abadi & Cardelli's $\zeta$-calculus for OOP |
| $\eta$ (eta) | Taken — eta conversion/reduction |
| $\theta$ (theta) | **Available** — no established calculus claims it |
| $\iota$ (iota) | Taken — iota reduction (Coq), iota combinator calculus |
| $\kappa$ (kappa) | Taken — Hasegawa's $\kappa$-calculus |

| $\tau$ (tau) | Taken — conventional metavariable for types |
| $\upsilon$ (upsilon) | Available, mnemonic "u" for unlayering, but uncommon and easy to confuse with $v$ |
| $\varphi$ (phi) | Borderline — niche uses in process algebra |
| $\chi$ (chi) | Taken — Fu's $\chi$-calculus (mobile processes) |
| $\psi$ (psi) | Taken — Bengtson et al.'s $\psi$-calculus |
| $\omega$ (omega) | Taken — omega combinator; also ordinals |

## Why $\theta$ was chosen

- **Unclaimed.** No major calculus in programming language theory or type theory
  is named the $\theta$-calculus. Big-$\Theta$ in complexity theory is an unrelated
  domain and does not cause confusion.
- **Familiar and legible.** $\theta$ is one of the most recognizable Greek letters,
  easy to read, write, and pronounce in both formal and informal settings.
- **Pairs well with $\lambda$.** The name "$\theta$-calculus" reads naturally alongside
  "$\lambda$-calculus," signaling that this system is a sibling extension rather than
  something unrelated.
